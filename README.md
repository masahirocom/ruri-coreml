# ruri-coreml

[cl-nagoya/ruri-v3](https://huggingface.co/collections/cl-nagoya/ruri-japanese-general-text-embeddings) (a Japanese sentence embedding model) converted to Core ML for on-device use on iOS, plus an iOS app comparing it against Apple's own on-device embedding model (`NLContextualEmbedding`).

*(日本語版READMEはこちら: [README_ja.md](README_ja.md))*

**Requirements:** Xcode 16+, a physical iPhone (see `REPORT.md` for why the Simulator isn't recommended for this model), [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen), Python 3.10+ (only if converting a model yourself).

## What's here

- **[`RuriDemo/`](RuriDemo/)** — a SwiftUI iOS app that runs ruri-v3 via Core ML and Apple's `NLContextualEmbedding` side by side on the same queries, so you can compare their rankings directly on a real device.
- **[`ruri_coreml/ruri_coreml_convert/`](ruri_coreml/ruri_coreml_convert/)** — the Python pipeline used to convert ruri-v3 checkpoints to Core ML, quantize them, and prepare everything an iOS app needs to bundle one.
- **[`REPORT.md`](REPORT.md)** — a write-up comparing ruri-v3 against Apple's on-device Japanese/English embedding models on a semantic search task spanning modern Japanese, classical Japanese, and English.

## Converted models

Pre-converted `.mlpackage` files are published on Hugging Face — no need to run the conversion yourself unless you want a different size/sequence-length/precision:

- [masahiroid/ruri-v3-130m-coreml](https://huggingface.co/masahiroid/ruri-v3-130m-coreml)
- [masahiroid/ruri-v3-310m-coreml](https://huggingface.co/masahiroid/ruri-v3-310m-coreml)

Each size is published as **fp16** and as **int8** (weight-quantized from fp16), at sequence lengths 128/256/512. On an iPhone 17 Pro (iOS 27) both run on the GPU/Neural Engine at about 5 ms per sentence; int8 is half the size with near-identical scores, so it's the recommended choice for mobile apps.

## Running the iOS app

```bash
cd RuriDemo
./scripts/download_model.sh   # fetches the 130m fp16 + int8 models from Hugging Face into RuriDemo/RuriDemo/Resources
xcodegen generate
open RuriDemo.xcodeproj
```

Set your own signing team in Xcode, add the downloaded `.mlpackage` files to the target if needed, and run on a real device. See [`RuriDemo/MANUAL.md`](RuriDemo/MANUAL.md) for details.
